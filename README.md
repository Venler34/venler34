## Current Project

As a basketball player, I was interested in building software that could track the number of shots I can make. This way I can get metrics on statistics when shooting from different shots on the court. This way I can learn what I need to work on.  

Currently working on model to predict number of shots made using transfer learning, here's a demo of what I got so far. I'm hoping to get this model to work with any basketball and any court.
